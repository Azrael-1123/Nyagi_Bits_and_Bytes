Guidelines:
Do not put models in the root models folder, put them in a subfolder.
Do not add single texture models, let datagen take care of those.
Folders named after mods contain models primarily related to its assembly.
Science contains schematic and test models.
Unknown is for unpaired or unused models.
Misc is for everything else.
If you don't know where to put it, toss it in misc. Just...put it in a subfolder.
